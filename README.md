# PyPipBadgeFixBot
A bot that can fix broken pypip.in badges in READMEs and automatically create pull requests with the changes. See [this blog post](http://movermeyer.com/2018-03-08-building-bots-to-mend-badges/) for more details.

**WARNING:** This was **not** a good idea, since GitHub does not allow you to do automatic, unsolicited, issues or pull requests ("activity"). Running this will result in your account being suspended.
